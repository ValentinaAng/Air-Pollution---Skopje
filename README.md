# Project Name:
AIR Pollution in Skopje

# Project Description
This Python project aims to analyze air pollution in Skopje, utilizing fundamental Python programming concepts.
Skopje, the capital city of North Macedonia, has been grappling with air pollution issues for years, primarily due to industrial activities, vehicle emissions, and geographical factors. 
This project endeavors to provide insights into the air quality situation in Skopje through data analysis.

# Dataset
The following dataset has been taken from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cokastefan/pm10-pollution-data-in-skopje-from-2008-to-2018). To make our task more managable, we will only be looking at data for the time period of five years, from January 2012 to December 2016.

# Table of Content
1. Data Analysis (including cleaning, handling missing values, etc.)
2. Answering questions which were addressed in the project:
  - What location in Skopje has the highest average pollution for each of the pollutants?
  - For every year, for each of the pollutants, on what time stamp is the maximum pollution for every location? What time of the year seems to have the most pollution in Skopje?
  - In what month of the year is the average polution accross locations highest for each of the pollutants?
  - What is the average pollution accross locations in every hour during the day?
  - Calculate and display the average daily pollution accross locations on separate plots for each of the pollutants over time.
  - If the range of values for PM10 considered safe and unsafe is according to the following scale:
      Good 0-50
      Moderate 51-154
      Unhealthy for sensitive individuals 155-254
      Unhealthy 255-354
      Very unhealthy 355-424
      Hazardous 425-504
      On how many days in each year, was the average value of PM10 meauserd accross locations worse than moderate?
 - On how many days in each year, was the value of PM10 measured on at least one location worse than moderate?
 - Make a bar plot showing the average number of days per year when the measured value for PM10 was worse than moderate on at least one location.
